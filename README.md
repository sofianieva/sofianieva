## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Over the course of the last few years I've taken many Data Science and Machine Learning courses at different universities and worked on many interesting projects. Here you can find some of them:

### Personal Projects
- [Today's vs. Past Weather App](https://github.com/sofianieva/weather_app). End-to-end project: Data retrieval from public API's, cleaning and exploration. Design of an interactive visualization with plotly and streamlit. Hosted on AWS, available at http://35.88.156.189:8501/.
- Football Analytics (coming soon). The main ideas are, given the skill attributes of a player, to calculate some summary statistics and suggest which is the best position for that player.

### School Projects
- Course Data Science and Machine Learning in Python, Dortmund University
  -  [Assignments](https://github.com/sofianieva/dortmund), which includes a Market Basket Analysis, Fraud Detection in Retail, Ecommerce Company Analysis, among other data wrangling, data cleaning and machine learning projects.

- Diploma in Data Science and Machine Learning, University of Cordoba:
